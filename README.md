# StyleInheritanceApp
This app shows off Style Inheritance, rather than performing an action.  Attributes specified in "activity_main.xml" take precedence over their "style" (specified in "styles.xml").  If no attribute is given, it will take from its "style".  Similarly, styles can inherit from each other.  "style_1.style_2" inherits from its "parent", "style_1".  Again, if an alternative attribute is specified, it will (in most cases) not inherit from its parent but rather use the attributes specified.  This can be seen where "Button 2" is specified as "blue" in XML, while its style says "green".  And "style_1.style_2" inherits from "style_1", but it specifies its color attribute as "green" rather than "red" in the "style_1" that it inherits other attributes from.
